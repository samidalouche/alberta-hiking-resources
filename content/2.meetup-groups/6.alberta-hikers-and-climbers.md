## Purpose

[Alberta Hikers & Climbers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1409264842848628) is a **private** Facebook group to meet hikers, scramblers, and climbers through an environment 
where members can connect, share experiences, and build lasting friendships. 

- The group caters to those with an intermediate to advanced skill level in either hiking or climbing. 
- The group is not dedicated to finding activity partners, but the community is tight-knit and people use the group to coordinate activities.
- The group is used to post about trail conditions, scrambling routes, to find partners for avalanche and crevasse rescue courses, etc.
- The group is a place where you interact with people first (share tips, ask information, etc) to build connections, and then find hiking/scrambling/climbing partners as a result of the interaction.
  
## Safety warnings

::warning
Be aware that hikes and scrambles posted on this group might be extremely difficult scrambles or climbs. Do your own research to ensure that you know what you are getting into and be prepared to be self-reliant in case the group you join needs to split. When in doubt, ask the event's organizer. Event organizers are not guides responsible for your safety. They are simply hiking companions who are posting their hikes.
::


::warning
The group isn't a structured organization. Each hike organizer has his/her own philosophy and rules, so make sure to confirm expectations when you join a hike. If you don't like the rules of the current organizers, you are more than welcome to post your own hikes with the rules you want.
