## Meetup.com Groups


The following [Meetup.com](https://meetup.com) groups generally have a more formal leadership, 
so they are a great place to start for poeple looking for a more structured hiking environment.

- [Slow and Steady Hikers](https://www.meetup.com/slow-and-steady-hikers/): Even though advertised as "slow and steady", the actual speed depends on each organizer. Each organizer vets the participants and
  in some cases, even have a waitlist.
- [Calgary Nature and Social Adventures](https://www.meetup.com/calgary-nature-and-social-adventures/)
- [Calgary/Banff Hiking, X-C Skiing, and Snowshoeing](https://www.meetup.com/calgarybanffhikingmeetup/)
