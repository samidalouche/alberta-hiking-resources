## Maps

If someone reading this has in-depth knowledge of all these apps and the key differences / differentiating factors, please do not hesitate to contribute improvements to this section.

## Mobile map app suggestions:

- [Gaia GPS](https://www.gaiagps.com/): A subscription-based app providing offline maps, layers, ability to import GPX files, etc.
- [On X Maps](https://www.onxmaps.com/backcountry/app) is an alternative worth checking out.
- [Outmap](https://www.outmap.pro/) advertise themselves as the best FATMAP replacement (no longer available after the Strava acquisition).
- [Caltopo](https://caltopo.com/map.html) is also worth considering.
- [Hiiker](https://hiiker.app/) is yet another alternative.
