## Facebook Groups

In addition to serving as general-purpose inspirational groups, these groups can provide timely feedback in terms of trail conditions, closures, etc:
- [Hike Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1644376389112687) is probably the most popular Facebook group when it comes to looking for inspiration, pictures, and practical information.
  It is a bit of a monster in terms of volume of posts, and the approach is to give a little bit of everything for everyone.
- [Wild Canadian Rocky Mountain Hikers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1907088892741238) is a popular group for advanced hikers and scramblers. The moderation team is trying their best to promote best practices and knowledge.
- [Scrambling in the Canadian Rockies](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2251181818/) is a popular group among [scramblers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambling). The Scrambling in the Canadian Rockies group is for sharing trip reports and conditions, finding partners, and seeking advice related to scrambling in the Canadian Rockies.
