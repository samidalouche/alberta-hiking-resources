## 📣 Call for Help

[Sami](/hike-organizers/sami) — the original creator of this site — is full of hiking stoke but not quite full of all the knowledge in the Rockies 🏔️.

This site isn't meant to be a one-hiker show… it's an open trailhead for a shared effort to make info better, richer, and more helpful for everyone 📚.

👋 Wanna Lend a Boot?

You're more than welcome to contribute if any of this sounds like you:
- 🌐 You know of great hiking groups we should highlight, or can help flesh out info on the ones already listed 📝
- 🥾 You're a hike organizer and want to share your vibe, style, and what folks should expect on your adventures 💬
- 🔧 You've got trail wisdom to drop — whether it's safety tips, gear recs, or “I learned this the hard way” kind of knowledge 🧠

Whether it's a quick fix, a full section, or just a friendly pointer to better info — every little bit helps 🫶🌲
Let's build this trail guide together! 🛠️🗺️✨
