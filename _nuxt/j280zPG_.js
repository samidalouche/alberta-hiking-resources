## Purpose

[Alberta Hikers Together](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether): Find hiking friends by advertising and joining hiking/scrambling events. 

The group's **sole objective** is to provide a space to connect hikers. Please **refrain from posting any other information**, except pictures of **previously-advertised** hikes that help build the desire to join the next hiking events. Additionally, if you have an extra camping spot that you won't use, you are welcome to advertise it for the same face value.

You are **highly encouraged** to create actionable posts or events that advertise a specific hike, with a meeting time. If you're looking for hiking partners in general, but don't have specific hikes/dates in mind, [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367) may be a better place for you to post.

## How is it different than the other FB groups?

Understand how this group relates to [other groups](/hiking-groups/by-category). More specifically:
- Check out the [Meetup Groups](/hiking-groups/by-category/meetups) page to understand the similarities and differences with other meetup groups.
- There are better groups to ask information about [hiking trails, conditions, trail closures, bear attacks](/hiking-groups/by-category/practical-information), etc. 

Note that this is a **public** group (the content can be accessed without joining the group). This makes it possible for instance to create and 
  share an [event](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether/events/) to people who are not members of the group (i.e. in other groups, private discussions, etc).

## What are the group rules?

The [rules](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether/about) of the group are minimalistic and mostly common sense: as long as you are respectful and **stay on topic**, you are welcome to participate.

The rest of this section describes the rationale for each of the rules that are in place.

### Be kind and courteous

> We're all in this together to create a Welcoming environment. Let's treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness is required.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** We want the group to be fun to interact with and leave toxicity out. 

### No hate speech or bullying

> Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn't allowed, and degrading comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** We want the group to be fun to interact with and leave toxicity out. 

### No promotions or spam

> Give more than you take in this group. Self-promotion, spam and irrelevant links aren't allowed. Legit links to other free groups or pages that help people organize events and find hiking friends are encouraged though.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** As mentioned previously, the group's **sole objective** is to provide a space to connect hikers. Please **refrain from posting any other information**.

### Stay on topic

> The group's objective is to organize and participate to hiking events in AB,BC, and MT. Photos and trip reports of events previously announced on the group are welcome to encourage others to join the next events. Questions about hikes, trail conditions, etc should be redirected to other groups such as Alberta Hikers&Climbers, or Wild Canadian Rocky Mountain Hikers that have more active communities in that regard. Let's do one thing, and do it well: find hiking buddies for AB, BC, MT.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** The reason Alberta Hikers Together was created was because the other groups made it harder to organize or join events as the meetup posts are diluted in the amount of other information being provided. So the idea is to keep this group hyper-focused on finding hiking partners. Posting pictures / trip reports is only encouraged for people who posts their hikes on the group, as it helps to build excitement about joining the next trips. But people who do not post their hikes on the group should refrain from posting their pictures. [Inspirational Groups](/hiking-groups/by-category/inspirational) and groups providing [practical information](/hiking-groups/by-category/practical-information) are a better match for this purpose.

### Your safety is your responsibility

> None of the trips are hosted by professional guides and all of us have average navigation skills. You assume all responsibility for your safety, well-being, and preparedness.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** To remind people that nobody in the group is a professional guide. You should assume that the people you hike with have average mountain and navigation skills and you assume all responsibility for your safety, well-being and preparedness. Do your own research to ensure that you know what you are getting into and be prepared to be self-reliant in case we have to split.

### No unsolicited direct messages

> Use the public group to reach out to other members. Inappropriate messages will not be tolerated.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** The group's sole purpose is to provide a space to connect hikers. Nothing else. If someone advertises a hike and you want to join, feel free to reach out to them. Otherwise, consider that to be inappropriate.

### Sales

> No selling of items and gear. Camping and backcountry sites may be posted here for the same face value. Add markups and you will be banned.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** If you have an extra camping spot that you won't use, you are welcome to advertise it for the same face value. It's a great way to connect with other hikers if you're only going to use one car/tent out of the two allowed on your camping site. And by extension, even if you can't make it all, you're still welcome to advertise it, it will make someone else's weekend!
What we want to avoid though are scalpers and scammers. Anyone doing shady deals will be banned.



## Safety warnings

::alert{type="danger" icon="lucide:circle-x"}
  Be aware that hikes and scrambles advertised on this group might range from a little walk along the river to extremely difficult scrambles. Do your own research to ensure that you know what you are getting into and be prepared to be self-reliant in case the group you join needs to split. When in doubt, ask the event's organizer. Event organizers are not guides responsible for your safety. They are simply hiking companions who are advertising their hikes.
::

::alert{type="warning" icon="lucide:triangle-alert"}
The group isn't a structured organization. Each hike organizer has his/her own philosophy and rules, so make sure to confirm expectations when you join a hike. If you don't like the rules of the current organizers, you are more than welcome to advertise your own hikes with the rules you want.
