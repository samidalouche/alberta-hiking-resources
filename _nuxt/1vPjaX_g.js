## Motivation

We gathered information and links that we think are useful to hiking and scrambling in the Canadian Rockies:

1. [Hiking Groups](/hiking-groups/): There are so many Facebook and Meetup groups related to hiking in Alberta that it's easy to get lost in the jungle. Let's highlight a few decent options to give newcomers an entry point.
2. [Hike Organizers](/hike-organizers) Provide a space for hike organizers to provide more information about their philosophy, rules, and describe what to expect when joining their hikes. Facebook events and posts can be too limiting, hard to read, and require avoidable copy-paste to express such information.
3. [Practical Information and Frequently Asked Questions](/practical-information): Gear Recommendations, Trail and Safety Information, etc

If the information is already present somewhere else, let's link to it. The goal isn't to duplicate existing information but to make it more easily available.

## Call for Help

The original author of this site, Sami, isn't knowlegeable enough to come up with all the information by himself. As a result, the hope is that by initiating this effort, other contributors will help make this more useful.

In particular, you are welcome [to contribute](/getting-started/contributing) if:
- You know of additional groups worth mentioning, or would like to improve the background information of the groups that are currently highlighted.
- You are a hike organizer and would like to share what people can expect when they join your hikes
- You would like to contribute general information about trails, safety, or gear.
