## Introduction

::alert{type="info" icon="lucide:info"}
If you regularly organize hikes (regardless of the group) and would like to add a section to describe your hiking philosophy or rules, please reach out!

We would like to give each organizer some space to tell hikers what they can expect when they join one of their hikes.
