## Meetups

### Facebook Meetup Groups

These Facebook groups are useful to find hiking/scrambling, and even climbing partners:

- [Alberta Hikers Together](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether): Dedicated to finding hiking/scrambling partners. [More info](/hiking-groups/group-info/alberta-hikers-together).
- [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367): Dedicated to finding hiking/scrambling partners. [More info](/hiking-groups/group-info/find-hiking-groups-partners-alberta)
- [Alberta Hikers & Climbers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1409264842848628): Not dedicated to finding hiking/scrambling partners, but the community is tight-knit and people use the group to coordinate activities. [More info](/hiking-groups/group-info/alberta-hikers-and-climbers)


Difference between [Alberta Hikers Together](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether) and:
- [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367): 
  - The two groups have very similar goals and rules. 
  - Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta has more members and is a bit more active.
  - Alberta Hikers Together is a public group, so when cross posting in different groups, it's easier to post first in Alberta Hikers Together, and then share to the other groups.
- [Alberta Hikers & Climbers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1409264842848628): 
  - Alberta Hikers & Climbers caters to those with an intermediate to advanced skill level in either hiking or climbing.
  - The Alberta Hikers & Climbers community is more tight-knit, and not just focused on finding hiking partners. People ask and post about trail conditions, avalanche and crevasse rescue courses, 
    scrambling routes, indoor climbing events, etc.
  - Alberta Hikers & Climbers is a place where you interact with people first (share tips, ask information, etc) to build connections, and then find hiking/scrambling/climbing partners as a result of the interaction.
