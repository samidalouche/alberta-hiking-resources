# Facebook Meetups

## Highlights

The following Facebook groups are useful to find hiking/scrambling, and even climbing partners.

These hiking meetup groups are grassroots communities where events are organized organically by members rather than through any formal leadership.

There's no central organizer or hierarchy—just like-minded hikers coming together to share adventures, suggest outings, and connect over a shared love of the outdoors.

If you're looking for a flexible, community-driven way to meet hiking partners, these groups are a great place to start.

- [Alberta Hikers Together](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Dedicated to finding hiking/scrambling partners. [More info](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/meetup-groups/alberta-hikers-together).
- [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Also dedicated to finding hiking/scrambling partners. [More info](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/meetup-groups/find-hiking-groups-partners-alberta)
- [Alberta Hikers & Climbers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1409264842848628){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Not dedicated to finding hiking/scrambling partners, but the community is tight-knit and people use the group to coordinate activities. [More info](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/meetup-groups/alberta-hikers-and-climbers)

Difference between [Alberta Hikers Together](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} and:

- [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}:
  - The two groups have very similar goals and rules.
  - Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta has more members and is a bit more active.
  - Alberta Hikers Together encourages posting specific hiking events (come up with a suggestion you'd like to hike, and a meeting time), whereas Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta has a lot of posts about people looking for hiking buddies without specific hikes in mind.
  - Alberta Hikers Together is a public group, so when cross posting in different groups, it's easier to post first in Alberta Hikers Together, and then share to the other groups.
- [Alberta Hikers & Climbers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1409264842848628){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}:
  - Alberta Hikers & Climbers caters to those with an intermediate to advanced skill level in either hiking or climbing.
  - The Alberta Hikers & Climbers community is more tight-knit, and not just focused on finding hiking partners. People ask and post about trail conditions, avalanche and crevasse rescue courses,
    scrambling routes, indoor climbing events, etc.
  - Alberta Hikers & Climbers is a place where you interact with people first (share tips, ask information, etc) to build connections, and then find hiking/scrambling/climbing partners as a result of the interaction.

## Purpose

[Alberta Hikers & Climbers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1409264842848628){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} is a **private** Facebook group to meet hikers, scramblers, and climbers through an environment
where members can connect, share experiences, and build lasting friendships.

- The group caters to those with an intermediate to advanced skill level in either hiking or climbing.
- The group is not dedicated to finding activity partners, but the community is tight-knit and people use the group to coordinate activities.
- The group is used to post about trail conditions, scrambling routes, to find partners for avalanche and crevasse rescue courses, etc.
- The group is a place where you interact with people first (share tips, ask information, etc) to build connections, and then find hiking/scrambling/climbing partners as a result of the interaction.

## Safety warnings

::warning
Be aware that hikes and scrambles posted on this group might be extremely difficult scrambles or climbs. Do your own research to ensure that you know what you are getting into and be prepared to be self-reliant in case the group you join needs to split. When in doubt, ask the event's organizer. Event organizers are not guides responsible for your safety. They are simply hiking companions who are posting their hikes.
::

::warning
The group isn't a structured organization. Each hike organizer has his/her own philosophy and rules, so make sure to confirm expectations when you join a hike. If you don't like the rules of the current organizers, you are more than welcome to post your own hikes with the rules you want.

  :::

## Purpose

[Alberta Hikers Together](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Share your hike plans here and join others on their adventures.

**Objective**: Share your hike plans here and join others on their adventures. When posting, be sure to include the date, time, and location. Feel free to share photos—but only from events listed in this group. For everything else, please use other groups.

If you're looking for hiking partners in general, but don't have specific hikes/dates in mind, [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} may be a better place for you to post.

## How is it different from the other FB groups?

Understand how this group relates to [other meetup groups](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/meetup-groups). More specifically:

- Check out the [Meetup Groups](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/meetup-groups) page to understand the similarities and differences with other meetup groups.
- There are better groups to ask information about [hiking trails, conditions, trail closures, bear attacks](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/hiking-scrambling-beta), etc.

Note that unlike most other groups, this is a **public** group (the content can be accessed without joining the group). This makes it possible for instance to create and
share an [event](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether/events/){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} to people who are not members of the group (i.e. in other groups, private discussions, etc).

## What are the group rules?

The [rules](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether/about){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} of the group are minimalistic and mostly common sense: as long as you are respectful and **stay on topic**, you are welcome to participate.

The rest of this section describes the rationale for each of the rules that are in place.

### Be kind and courteous

> We're all in this together to create a Welcoming environment. Let's treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness is required.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** We want the group to be fun to interact with and leave toxicity out.

### No hate speech or bullying

> Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn't allowed, and degrading comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** We want the group to be fun to interact with and leave toxicity out.

### No promotions or spam

> Give more than you take in this group. Self-promotion, spam and irrelevant links aren't allowed. Legit links to other free groups or pages that help people organize events and find hiking friends are encouraged though.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** As mentioned previously, the group's **sole objective** is to provide a space to connect hikers. Please **refrain from posting any other information**.

### Stay on topic

> Let’s keep it simple and focused: Share your hike plans here and join others on their adventures. When posting, be sure to include the date, time, and location. Feel free to share photos—but only from events listed in this group. For everything else, please use other groups.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** The reason Alberta Hikers Together has been created is because the general-purpose hiking groups often buried meetup posts under a flood of other content. The idea here is to make it easier to find hiking partners.

Posting pictures / trip reports is especially encouraged for people who post their hike plans in the group, since it helps to build excitement for upcoming trips. [Inspirational Groups](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/hiking-scrambling-beta) and groups providing [practical information](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/hiking-scrambling-beta) are a better match for those who want to share photos of past adventures without organizing a hike.

Finally, we ask that members be specific about the date, time, and trails/hikes being planned. Not only does this make posts more actionable for others, it also helps combat spammers who tend to post vague, non-actionable requests.

If you’re looking to post general requests for hiking partners, check out [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}—they’re happy to welcome those kinds of posts.

### Your safety is your responsibility

> None of the trips are hosted by professional guides and all of us have average navigation skills. You assume all responsibility for your safety, well-being, and preparedness.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** To remind people that nobody in the group is a professional guide. You should assume that the people you hike with have average mountain and navigation skills and you assume all responsibility for your safety, well-being and preparedness. Do your own research to ensure that you know what you are getting into and be prepared to be self-reliant in case we have to split.

If you want more structured events, check out the [Meetup.com groups](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/meetup-groups/meetup.com) that tend to have stable organizers that enforce stricter rules.

### No unsolicited direct messages

> Use the public group to reach out to other members. Inappropriate messages will not be tolerated.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** The group's sole purpose is to provide a space to connect hikers. Nothing else. If someone posts a hike and you want to join, feel free to reach out to them. Otherwise, consider that to be inappropriate.

### Sales

> No selling of items and gear. Camping and backcountry sites may be posted here for the same face value. Add markups and you will be banned.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** If you have an extra camping spot that you won't use, you are welcome to post it for the same face value. It's a great way to connect with other hikers if you're only going to use one car/tent out of the two allowed on your camping site. And by extension, even if you can't make it all, you're still welcome to post it, it will make someone else's weekend!
What we want to avoid though are scalpers and scammers. Anyone doing shady deals will be banned.

# Guidebooks

## Hiking

To start your journey in the Canadian Rockies:

- [Don't Waste Your Time in the Canadian Rockies](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5041-091/don%27t-waste-your-time-in-the-canadian-rockies){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Their selection of hikes is an amazing starting point in the Canadian Rockies.
  The book only covers the national parks (Banff, Jasper, Kootenay, Yoho and Waterton Lakes national parks, plus Mt. Robson and Mt. Assiniboine provincial parks), not the Kananaskis / Canmore region.

## Scrambling

The two popular scrambling references used by the local community are:

- [Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies (Alan Kane)](https://a.co/d/04zppz97){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Covers Waterton, Crowsnest, Kananaskis, Canmore, Banff, Yoho, Kootenay, and Jasper
- [More Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies (Andrew Nugara)](https://a.co/d/0i6t2ZM8){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Comprehensively covers Waterton, The Castle, and Kananaskis. Also includes scrambles in Crowsnest, Banff, Highway 93 North, and Yoho.

For those interested in scrambling in Montana Glacier National Park, just south of the border:

- [Climb Glacier National Park, Blake Passmore](https://www.amazon.ca/Climb-Glacier-National-Park-Garden-ebook/dp/B0FGQWQ9NR){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}
  - Volumes: [1](https://www.amazon.ca/Climb-Glacier-National-Park-Garden-ebook/dp/B0FGQWQ9NR){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}, [2](https://www.amazon.ca/Climb-Glacier-National-Park-Firebrand-ebook/dp/B0FGSD3WFL){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}, [3](https://www.amazon.ca/Climb-Glacier-National-Park-Northern-ebook/dp/B0FGST3H8M){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}, [4](https://www.amazon.ca/Climb-Glacier-National-Park-Valley-ebook/dp/B0FGL28GB5){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}, [5](https://www.amazon.ca/Climb-Glacier-National-Park-Marias-ebook/dp/B0FGKVQ4R3){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}

## Facebook Groups

In addition to serving as general-purpose inspirational groups, these groups can provide timely feedback in terms of trail conditions, closures, etc:

- [Hike Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1644376389112687){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} is probably the most popular Facebook group when it comes to looking for inspiration, pictures, and practical information.

## Weather Forecasts

[Happiest Outdoors](https://happiestoutdoors.ca){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} published a guide called [The Best Weather Apps for Hiking](https://happiestoutdoors.ca/weather-apps-for-hiking/#The_Best_Weather_Websites_and_Apps_for_Hikers){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} that provides an introduction to some of these weather apps:

- [Spotwx](https://spotwx.com/){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Spot weather forecasting tool allowing to compare the forecasts of different models for arbitrary GPS locations (Spot = a point or specific location, Wx = short for weather).
- [Mountain Forecast](https://www.mountain-forecast.com/){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: A forecasting tool allowing to check the forecast for a number of mountains.
- [Windy.com](https://www.windy.com){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: A powerful and versatile forecasting tool that provides many different layers (Wind, Smoke, Webcams, etc) and that allows visualization directly on a map.
- [Meteoblue](https://www.meteoblue.com){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}: Similarly to Spotwx, allows to compare the forecasts of different models. [Direct access to the map](https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/maps#coords=6/50.642/-116.151&map=windAnimation~rainbow~auto~10%20m%20above%20gnd~none){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}

# Trail Conditions & Trip Reports

## Official Announcements

A number of resources are available to get more information on the trail conditions (snow, mud) and closures (grizzly bears, etc).

For those new to the area, keep in mind that because of the accumulation of snow, most of the bigger hikes/objectives in the national parks
are only dry (read: accessible) from July 15th to September 15th.

Given that the weather is highly heterogeneous in the Rockies, it is often possible to find objectives that are dry before and after this period,
but these are usually in Kananaskis. You can narrow your search to: Exshaw area, Highway 40 north of Peter Lougheed, and West Bragg Creek.

Not all hike organizers are cut from the same trail map, and that's totally okay! Some love fast summits and no breaks, others prefer long picnics with 360° views. 🍕🏔️☀️

This section is here to give each organizer their own space to tell you what to expect when tagging along on one of their adventures.

## 🎯 Want to join a Sami hike?

So, you're thinking of joining a Sami hike? Woohoo! 🎉

If you've landed on this page, chances are you followed a link from one of my hiking invites and you're wondering:
“What exactly am I signing up for here?” 👣📨

What you need to know:

- 🧠 No Interviews: Unlike some organizers, I don't run a vetting process — no fitness tests, no gear checklists, no “are-you-worthy-of-this-hike” quizzes 📝🙅‍♂️. Instead, I believe in shared responsibility and good communication 🤝💬:
  - 🧭 I do my best to [describe my [hiking style]](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/hike-organizers/sami#what-to-expect-on-a-classic-sami-hike) and trip philosophy so you can decide if it feels like a good match 💛🥾
  - 🔍 You do your research to see if the hike fits your skills, experience, and comfort level. And if my plan seems fishy 🐟 or sketchy ❓— call me out! I'm no expert, just a stoked hiker with a spreadsheet.
  - 🎒 You choose your own adventure gear — food, water, maps, spikes, rainbow windbreakers — it's all up to you. 🗺️🥪💧 Don't complain if you're usually good with 1L of water and you end up needing 5L on a 15-hour Summer Sami Special hike that doesn't have any source of water along the way. Or if you're cold at the summit because all you brought is a windbreaker and don't usually enjoy long breaks at the summit. Be ultralight at your own risk!
- 🤔 Got questions or doubts? Just message me! I'm always down to chat and sort things out.
- 🎯 The goal isn't perfection. We're just trying to avoid those rare “oops-this-wasn't-a-fit” moments 🚫🤕
- Refer to the [What to Expect on a Classic Sami Hike](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/hike-organizers/sami#what-to-expect-on-a-classic-sami-hike) section to understand what a typical Sami hike looks like.

So if you like your hikes with honesty and a sprinkle of shared accountability…
Welcome to the crew 🏕️🫶

Let's plan smart, hike happy, and enjoy the wild together! 🌄✨

## 🥾 What to Expect on a Classic Sami Hike

### 💡 Key Takeaways

Here's what a typical Summer hike looks like when the sun is shining and the vibes are high:

⸻

📖 Know what you're getting into

- Most of the hikes I post are scrambles with difficult terrain (scree, loose/crumbly rock).
- While every hike differs, I usually plan 12-to-15-hour days when I expect bluebird skies + warm temps, and 7-10 hour days otherwise.
- The technical term to describe these is sufferfest 🤭, so don't trust the stats (distance/elevation), they don't tell the whole story! 😎
- The [Hiking & Scrambling Beta section](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/hiking-scrambling-beta) page links to useful resources to help with the planning process.

⸻

⏰ Early Starts = Maximum Fun

- 5:00am at the trailhead is the norm 😴🌄 — sometimes even earlier for those extra-spicy objectives 🏔️🔥
- In Spring/Fall, we sleep in (a little) — usually around 7:00am starts, since it's too chilly for long snack + photo breaks ❄️

⸻

🚦 Starts On Time, Every Time

- Respecting the early birds 🐦 means we start at the posted time!
- Meeting time = 15 mins before the hike begins.
  So if the hike starts at 5am and you roll up at 5:05… you're actually 20 minutes late. Oops! ⏳😅

⸻

📸 Picture Breaks Galore

- When the sun's out and the mountains are sparkling ✨, I'm on a photo frenzy. Expect lots of stops!
- Hate photo breaks? Join a colder weather hike — the colder it is, the fewer pics I take 😬📷
- Love being trail-famous? Wear bright colors and strike a pose — I share all pics in full-res after! 🎨👯‍♂️🖼️

⸻

🐢🏃‍♂️ “Moderate” Pace — Whatever That Means

- I say moderate… but everyone defines that differently 🤷‍♂️
- Boring trail? We zoom 🛣️💨
  Epic views? We slow to a crawl for photos and oohs and ahhs 🐌📸🌄
- When there is a beautiful alpine lake or an inviting waterfall pool, we always take time for a cold dip! 👙🩲
- If the event is listed as “fast,” I mean it! Otherwise, expect a mixed rhythm that adapts to the trail.

⸻

🧀🛋️ Summit = Lounge Zone

- If the weather's nice, expect to chill for hours at the top 😎🧺
  Food, naps, views, deep chats — it's a summit hang, not a summit sprint.
- Not a fan of long breaks? You've got options:
  1. 👋 It's cool to split off early if you want to head down.
  2. 🧊 Come on colder-season hikes — I'm not a summit-sitter when it's freezing!

⸻

🏁 Finishing with Style

- Goal = start hiking early-enough to wrap up by 5pm without rushing, especially on Saturdays so we can:
  - 🏊‍♂️ Go for a cold dip
  - 🍻 Celebrate with a post-hike beer
  - 🏕️ Still have time to chill at camp
  - 🛌 💤 Go to bed early, to be ready for another adventure the next day!
- 📆 On Sundays (Fundays), I'm happy to finish later — let traffic pass and ride the mellow wave home 🚗
- 🕠 If plans shift, no stress — starting early gives us plenty of cushion to wrap up later. I like planning with extra room for detours and surprises.

⸻

Ready for adventure? Bring good vibes, bright gear, and maybe a snack to share 😄👟🌈
See you on the trail! 🏔️💛

### ⚠️ Your Safety = Your Responsibility

Just a friendly heads-up: I'm not a pro mountain guide 🧢❌⛰️.
I've got average navigation skills, decent mountain sense, and a big love for adventure — but you are 100% in charge of your own safety, prep, and decisions 🧭🥾

Think of me as your enthusiastic trail buddy, not your personal GPS or mountain guru 🤓✨

⸻

📌 Here's what that means in practice:

- ❗ Don't assume I fully know what I'm doing — I often have plans, but Mother Nature might have other ideas ☁️🪨
- 🔍 Do your own research — read up, map it out, and know what you're getting into
- 🗺️ Bring your own maps and route info — be ready in case we need to split or adjust plans
- 🧃 Pack food + water like we're doing an epic — sunny days + long breaks = thirstier hikers 😅☀️
- 🪖 Bring the right gear (helmet, spikes, axe, whatever the mountain calls for). Not sure? Ask the crew!
- 🔦 Plans change! Extra layers and a headlamp can go from “nice to have” to “thank goodness I brought this” real fast 🌄🥶

⸻

The mountain doesn't care how confident we sound — so let's all come prepared, stay humble, and have each other's backs 💚🏕️🧠

We'll have way more fun knowing we've got the essentials just in case! 👣🎒

### 🧩 Sticking Together vs. Splitting the Group

Ah yes — the great trail debate: Should we all hike together like one big happy trail family? 👣👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
Or is it cool to split up if people are vibing at different paces? 🤷‍♂️🏃‍♀️🐢

Here's my take:
I'm 100% chill with splitting — especially in bigger groups (7–9 folks). It's totally normal for different hikers to settle into different paces 🚶‍♀️🏃‍♂️ and honestly, forcing a group to move as one mega-hiker can make things feel clunky and weird.

✨ Live and let hike! ✨
Sharing part of the trail is still sharing something special — even if we don't stick together the whole way 🏔️🧡

⸻

🧭 But What If Someone Overestimated the Hike?

It happens — we're all human (and occasionally overconfident 😅).
If someone's not feeling it, my take is: unless it's a safety emergency, we should look for smart, kind options 💡❤️ — like having them chill at a scenic spot while the group continues.

🔁 Loops are trickier than out-and-backs, so let's think things through before we split.

⸻

🧠 Things to Keep in Mind if We Do Split:

- 🐻 Minimum group size rules (hello, Parks Canada bear safety!) mean splitting may not be allowed
- ↩️ Out-and-backs are easier to manage — we'll be returning the same way anyway!
- 🗺️ Everyone should have maps + route info — don't assume someone else has it!
- 🧗‍♂️ How technical is the hike? A mellow walk or a spicy scramble?
- 🚶‍♀️ Is the trail busy or are we totally alone in the wilderness?
- 🚗 Carpool chaos is real — don't leave your ride behind without a plan 😬

⸻

BTW — this goes both ways! 💯
There have been times when I didn't feel good about pushing for a summit and waited for the group to go up and come back. It's all about mutual respect and using common sense 🧘‍♂️🌤️

If you're someone who really prefers sticking together the whole time, no problem! Just let me know before the hike so we can set expectations and avoid awkward trail drama 🗣️🤝

⸻

Bottom line: We use our brains, our hearts, and our GPS 📍💚🗺️ — and try not to split the group in silly ways. Deal?

## What to Expect on a Multi-Day Camping or Hut Trip

🏕️ First things first — my fave multi-day trips are the chill, flexible, go-with-the-flow kind 😎🌄. That means: no pressure to do everything together. Seriously.

The best vibes happen when everyone feels free to do their own thing by day — hike solo, chill at camp, chase peaks, nap in a meadow 💤🌼 — and then come together in the evening for laughs, shared food, and cozy campfire hangs 🔥🍲🌌.

Why I Love This Style:

- 🗺️ Everyone's explored different trails — we've all got different “must-dos”
- 🐢🐇 Pace, break style, and start time vary a lot — mine are in the [previous section](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/hike-organizers/sami#what-to-expect-on-a-classic-sami-hike), but I adapt depending on the weather 🌦️
- 🧘‍♀️ Some folks need chill rest days; others are ready to send it daily 💪. A diverse group means you'll have company regardless.
- 🤝 We don't need to match 100% — just be upfront about your style/preferences!
- 🔄 Bad weather tends to mellow everyone out anyway (later starts, shorter hikes), so magic compatibility can happen unexpectedly ☁️💫

☀️🌧️ How Weather & Smoke Shape My Plans:

- Bluebird skies + warm temps? Count me in for 3:00am starts and long, leisurely summit hangs: 12-to-15-hour days 😍📸
- Smoky skies? I'm out. Those are rest/snack/book/lake float days 😷📖🛶
- Cloudy but dry? Let's hit the mid-tier hikes: 7-10 hour days — still fun, just a little less photogenic ☁️
- Rainy? You'll need to be my motivational hype squad to get me up 1200m for a whiteout summit 😂⛰️☔️

⸻

🎯 Bottom line: We don't need to do everything together to have a great trip — A diverse group gives more options to everyone 🧡

And don't miss [What to Expect on a Classic Sami Hike](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/hike-organizers/sami#what-to-expect-on-a-classic-sami-hike)— it totally applies here too! 📚👀

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### ⏰ Why do your hikes start sooo early?

Ah yes, the infamous alpine start 🌄 — while some folks are hitting snooze, I'm already tying my boots in the dark 😴🥾

Here's the deal: different hikers have different priorities. Mine? I like to squeeze the juice out of every hiking day 🍋👣

Here's what I'm aiming for:

- 📸 Plenty of photo breaks — yes, we're hiking, but also yes, you will be asked to pose on a rock like a majestic mountain goat 🐐✨
- 🏔️ Long summit hangs — think hours at the top, soaking in views, sunshine, snacks, and trail tea 🧃☀️🧀
- 🍻 Early finish (\~5pm) — so we can celebrate with a cold dip 🏊‍♂️ and a cold beer 🍺 (or both!), followed by real food and early zzz's 😴
- 🛠️ Wiggle room for chaos — because let's be real: plans are great until the trail says “plot twist!” 🤪⛰️

To make all that magic happen, we start early. Like, really early.
Real-life examples:

- 🌅 Pharaoh Peak: started at 4am, caught sunrise at Healy Pass 🌄 (August 2022)
- 🏞️ Skyline Trail: started at 5am, because Jasper sun waits for no one 😎 (September 2023)

Oh — and just so you know, both of those were listed as “FAST” hikes 🏃‍♀️💨, not your average leisurely strolls. Pace yourself accordingly!

### 🕒 Why don't you wait for people who are late?

Great question! When I post a hike, the meeting time is actually 15 minutes before we hit the trail 🥾⏳ — that buffer is built in for bathroom breaks 🚻, gear tweaks 🎒, and tying those stubborn boot laces 👟.

So if we start hiking “on time,” we've actually already waited 15 minutes ⌛ — which feels like a fair grace period, right?

- Is 15 minutes a fair wait? I think so! 🤷‍♂️
- If not… what is? 🤔 Should we bring a stopwatch and take votes? 😄

Here's why I stick to this system:

- 📶 Many trailheads have no cell service, so waiting around for a text that never comes just doesn't work.
- 🧊 Early mornings can be chilly, and it's not fair to leave the punctual folks shivering while we wait.
- ✅ It keeps things simple, consistent, and respectful of everyone's time — especially at 4am when we're all half-asleep anyway 😴☕️

Bottom line: I love hiking with people… but I also love starting on time. If you're ever unsure, message me ahead of time or aim to arrive a little early 😋

### 📣 Where do you post your hikes?

I usually kick things off by creating an event on [Alberta Hikers Together](https://www.facebook.com/groups/406674690939732){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} 🏞️ — it's a public group, so anyone can see and join the fun! 🎉👀

Then I share it with a few other awesome trail-loving communities:

- 🔒 [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} – a private group full of friendly folks looking to hit the trails.
- 🔒 [Alberta Hikers & Climbers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1409264842848628){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} – for the mountain goats and rock scramblers among us 🐐🧗‍♀️

Also! There's a whole section on [meetup groups](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/meetup-groups) if you're curious about more ways to connect and hike with others 📅👣💬

### 🤔 Why don't you “vet” people like other organizers do?

Good question! Here's the deal:

- I don't really see myself as a capital-O Organizer 🙅‍♂️📋 — I'm just someone who loves hiking and enjoys sharing the trail with cool humans 🥾❤️
- Some organizers go full interview-mode before each hike… and honestly, that sounds like a lot of admin for my dirtbag lifestyle 😅⛺️. I'd rather spend that time chasing peaks than reading bios.
- So far, my track record is: one “oops” moment per summer (May–Nov) 🤷‍♂️ — nothing catastrophic, just the kind of thing you laugh about after snacks and rehydration 🧃🍫
- Plus, a few of those oopsies were kinda on me — setting better expectations is something I'm working on 👀📝
- And even if I wanted to vet folks… how good would I be at it? I'm still pretty new to Alberta 🐣⛰️ and learning this whole mountain game one trail at a time.
- Honestly? Most of the people I hike with are way more experienced and better prepared than me 🧠📚. Sometimes I feel like I'm tagging along on their hike!

So yeah — no gatekeeping here. Just vibes, transparency, and good-faith effort. Let's hike, learn, and laugh it off together 💬👣🔥

### 🤷‍♀️ I want to join a hike but can't commit just yet…

No worries at all — I'm super chill about it! 😎 If you can make it, awesome! If not, no hard feelings — catch you on the next adventure! 👋🥾

Just a tiny favor: if you're a maybe, please give me a heads-up 🙋‍♂️ and try not to lock in any carpool plans 🚗🚫 that could throw a wrench in everyone else's groove. Sharing is caring, after all! 💖✨

### 🚗 Can we carpool from Calgary?

I'm usually out camping under the stars 🌌 on Friday and Saturday nights from late June through early September — so carpooling on those weekends isn't in the cards for me. 🏕️✨

But when we're heading back from Calgary, I usually rally the troops to meet up and carpool from the trusty old [Petro Canada at Hwy 1 & 22](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MiFTBkwnhJCzxCEe7){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} ⛽️🚙. Perfect spot to fuel up and hit the road together!

Plus — every hike gets its own group chat 📱💬, so talk to you in there to find your carpool crew, share rides, or even trade snacks for the trip. 🥨🍫 Let's make the ride as fun as the hike!

### 🤔 What's the usual crew size on your hikes?

Most of my adventures roll with a cozy crew of 3-4 awesome humans 👫🥾— just the right vibe for good chats and laughs 😄.
Every now and then, we get a bigger party going — think 7-8 trailblazers strong! 🎉👣 More fun, more stories, more pictures 📸 !

### 🤔 Why do you post your hikes so late in the week?

Great question! Here's the deal: I'm in a committed relationship with good weather 😎☀️ — and I don't like getting ghosted by last-minute snowstorms ❄️ or surprise smoke 😷🔥.

The more unpredictable the conditions (hello, Alberta!), the longer I wait to lock in the plan. I like to save the big, epic hikes 🏔️💪 for those perfect bluebird days 🌈, and swap in more chill or flexible options when the forecast plays hard to get.

So yeah… sometimes a Saturday hike doesn't show up until Thursday night or even Friday afternoon 🕵️‍♂️📲. If you're curious what's cooking before I post, just shoot me a message — happy to give you a sneak peek 👀👟🎒

### 📝 Do you keep a log of your hikes?

You bet I do! 🤓🥾
Welcome to my treasure trove of trails — check out [the spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bi9QlnNzdtOEetXOotyN7IZTlS3qCa3vKy4vbVL_n-w/edit?usp=sharing){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"} 📊✨
It's packed with all the goodies: hike dates 📅, peak names 🏔️, stats 📈, and links to my Garmin adventures ⌚️💥

The Garmin portal doesn't show GPS tracks directly (rude, I know 😤), but if you want GPX files 🧭 or route info 🗺️, just give me a shout! I'm always happy to share the trail love 💌🌲

### 😷 Do you hike when it's smoky?

Not really my vibe — I like my lungs the way they are! 💨🫁
If the smoke rolls in and the forecast takes a turn, I'll usually cancel the hike or scramble.

That said, if you're feeling brave and still want to go full mountain goat without me, go for it! I'll be cheering you on from somewhere with cleaner air (and probably snacks).

### ⛺️ Can we go camping together?

Heck yes! I'd love that.

Start by checking out [What to expect when joining a multi-day camping or hut trip](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/hike-organizers/sami#what-to-expect-on-a-multi-day-camping-or-hut-trip) — it's full of helpful info and a few spicy surprises. 🌶️

If you're a planner, hit me up in 📅 November or December — that's when I start scheming and dreaming up 🌞 summer adventures. (Most of the national park bookings go live in January — it's a race, and we're in it to win it.)

If you're more of a last-minute butterfly 🦋, no worries — keep an eye on [the groups I post to](https://www.alberta-hiking-resources.org/hike-organizers/sami#where-do-you-post-your-hikes). Sometimes magic happens: someone cancels, and 💥 boom!
There's space for you to join the fun.

### 🥾 What is a Summer Sami Special™?

You'll know it's a Summer Sami Special™ when the magic recipe comes together just right:

- 🌞 Weather: That dreamy summer sweet sun, bluebird skies, and zero wildfire smoke in the air. Yes please.
- 🏔️ The Big Objective: A deliciously ridiculous goal — jaw-dropping views and a Type 2 fun sufferfest that leaves everyone's legs and soul equally wrecked (in the best way).
- 🎉 The Vibe: An amazing crew that turns a hike into a rolling party — full of laughs, deep chats, trail fun, and unforgettable memories.
- ⏰ Alpine Start O'Clock: If it's not before 4am, is it even a real Sami hike? Nope.
- 📸 Photoshoots Galore: We're talking model behavior here — goofy poses, epic action shots, candid trail joy, and more camera clicks than summit steps.
- 🍻 Post-Hike Joy: Done early enough to celebrate — cold drinks, lakeside dips, shared snacks, and stories flowing around a picnic table or campsite fire.

I don't get to pick the weather (unfortunately), but when the skies look good, I'll bring the big mountain goals — and yes, that means a very early start. The rest — the crew, the fun, the magic — that's all you. 🤝 Deal?
