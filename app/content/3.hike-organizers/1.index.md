## ✨ Meet the Hike Organizers

::alert{type=“info” icon=“lucide:info”}
💡 Are you a regular hike organizer? No matter what group you post in, if you’d like a little space to share your hiking vibe, rules, or trail philosophy — we’d love to include you! Just reach out! 🥾📝
::

Not all hike organizers are cut from the same trail map 🗺️ — and that’s totally okay! Some love fast summits and no breaks, others prefer long picnics with 360° views. 🍕🏔️☀️

This section is here to give each organizer their own space to tell you what to expect when tagging along on one of their adventures. No surprises (except for the views 😍).
