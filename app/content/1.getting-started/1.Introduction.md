## 💡 Why This Exists (a.k.a. The Motivation)

We pulled together a bunch of useful goodies for anyone hiking or scrambling in the Canadian Rockies 🏔️💚
Whether you’re brand new or just looking for a few pro tips, this is your one-stop forest-friendly info hub 🍃📚

⸻

Here’s what you’ll find:
1.	🌲 [Hiking Groups](/hiking-groups/)

    Alberta’s hiking scene has so many Facebook & Meetup groups, it’s easy to get lost in the jungle 🌴🧭
    So we’ve spotlighted some solid options to help you find your hiking fam 👣👯‍♂️
2.	🧭 [Hike Organizers](/hike-organizers)

    A cozy space for organizers to share their vibe, style, and what to expect on their hikes 📝💬
    Because let’s face it — Facebook posts aren’t exactly great for nuance or trail philosophy 😅
3.	🎒 [Practical Information](/practical-information)

    Gear tips, safety stuff, trail smarts, and all the “wait, what do I bring?” answers you didn’t know you needed 🤓🔦
3.	❓ [FAQ](/faq)

    Got a specific question buzzing in your brain? 🐝💭
    Chances are, we’ve answered it — or at least pretended to — in this section 😄📚

⸻

⛺ If it already exists elsewhere, we link to it — no need to reinvent the hiking pole! 🥢🙃
Our goal? Make great info easier to find, skip the fluff, and keep you focused on the adventure ahead 🌄📌

## 📣 Call for Help (Yes, You!)

Sami — the original creator of this site — is full of hiking stoke but not quite full of all the knowledge in the Rockies 😅🏔️
This site isn’t meant to be a one-hiker show… it’s an open trailhead for a shared effort to make info better, richer, and more helpful for everyone 🚀📚
