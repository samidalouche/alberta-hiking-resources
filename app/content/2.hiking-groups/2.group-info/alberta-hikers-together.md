## Purpose

[Alberta Hikers Together](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether): Share your hike plans here and join others on their adventures.

**Objective**: Share your hike plans here and join others on their adventures. When posting, be sure to include the date, time, and location. Feel free to share photos—but only from events listed in this group. For everything else, please use other groups.

If you're looking for hiking partners in general, but don't have specific hikes/dates in mind, [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367) may be a better place for you to post.

## How is it different than the other FB groups?

Understand how this group relates to [other groups](/hiking-groups/by-category). More specifically:
- Check out the [Meetup Groups](/hiking-groups/by-category/meetups) page to understand the similarities and differences with other meetup groups.
- There are better groups to ask information about [hiking trails, conditions, trail closures, bear attacks](/hiking-groups/by-category/practical-information), etc. 

Note that unlike most other groups, this is a **public** group (the content can be accessed without joining the group). This makes it possible for instance to create and 
  share an [event](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether/events/) to people who are not members of the group (i.e. in other groups, private discussions, etc).

## What are the group rules?

The [rules](https://www.facebook.com/groups/albertahikerstogether/about) of the group are minimalistic and mostly common sense: as long as you are respectful and **stay on topic**, you are welcome to participate.

The rest of this section describes the rationale for each of the rules that are in place.

### Be kind and courteous

> We're all in this together to create a Welcoming environment. Let's treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness is required.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** We want the group to be fun to interact with and leave toxicity out. 

### No hate speech or bullying

> Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn't allowed, and degrading comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** We want the group to be fun to interact with and leave toxicity out. 

### No promotions or spam

> Give more than you take in this group. Self-promotion, spam and irrelevant links aren't allowed. Legit links to other free groups or pages that help people organize events and find hiking friends are encouraged though.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** As mentioned previously, the group's **sole objective** is to provide a space to connect hikers. Please **refrain from posting any other information**.

### Stay on topic

> Let’s keep it simple and focused: Share your hike plans here and join others on their adventures. When posting, be sure to include the date, time, and location. Feel free to share photos—but only from events listed in this group. For everything else, please use other groups.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** The reason Alberta Hikers Together has been created is because the general-purpose hiking groups often buried meetup posts under a flood of other content. The idea here is to make it easier to find hiking partners.

Posting pictures / trip reports is especially encouraged for people who post their hike plans in the group, since it helps to build excitement for upcoming trips. [Inspirational Groups](/hiking-groups/by-category/inspirational) and groups providing [practical information](/hiking-groups/by-category/practical-information) are a better match for those who want to share photos of past adventures without organizing a hike.

Finally, we ask that members be specific about the date, time, and trails/hikes being planned. Not only does this make posts more actionable for others, it also helps combat spammers who tend to post vague, non-actionable requests.

If you’re looking to post general requests for hiking partners, check out [Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367)—they’re happy to welcome those kinds of posts.

### Your safety is your responsibility

> None of the trips are hosted by professional guides and all of us have average navigation skills. You assume all responsibility for your safety, well-being, and preparedness.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** To remind people that nobody in the group is a professional guide. You should assume that the people you hike with have average mountain and navigation skills and you assume all responsibility for your safety, well-being and preparedness. Do your own research to ensure that you know what you are getting into and be prepared to be self-reliant in case we have to split.

If you want more structured events, check out the [Meetup.com groups](/hiking-groups/by-category/meetups#meetupcom-groups) that tend to have stable organizers that enforce stricter rules.

### No unsolicited direct messages

> Use the public group to reach out to other members. Inappropriate messages will not be tolerated.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** The group's sole purpose is to provide a space to connect hikers. Nothing else. If someone posts a hike and you want to join, feel free to reach out to them. Otherwise, consider that to be inappropriate.

### Sales

> No selling of items and gear. Camping and backcountry sites may be posted here for the same face value. Add markups and you will be banned.

**Why do we have this rule in place?** If you have an extra camping spot that you won't use, you are welcome to post it for the same face value. It's a great way to connect with other hikers if you're only going to use one car/tent out of the two allowed on your camping site. And by extension, even if you can't make it all, you're still welcome to post it, it will make someone else's weekend!
What we want to avoid though are scalpers and scammers. Anyone doing shady deals will be banned.


## Safety warnings

::alert{type="danger" icon="lucide:circle-x"}
  Be aware that hikes and scrambles posted on this group might range from a little walk along the river to extremely difficult scrambles. Do your own research to ensure that you know what you are getting into and be prepared to be self-reliant in case the group you join needs to split. When in doubt, ask the event's organizer. Event organizers are not guides responsible for your safety. They are simply hiking companions who are posting their hikes.

::alert{type="warning" icon="lucide:triangle-alert"}
The group isn't a structured organization. Each hike organizer has his/her own philosophy and rules, so make sure to confirm expectations when you join a hike. If you don't like the rules of the current organizers, you are more than welcome to post your own hikes with the rules you want.
