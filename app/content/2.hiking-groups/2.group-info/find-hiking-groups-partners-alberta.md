## Purpose

[Find Hiking Groups/Partners, Alberta](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367) is a **private** Facebook group to advertise and join hiking events:

- The group's **sole objective** is to provide a space to connect hikers and organizers. Please **refrain from posting any other information**. 
  There are [better groups](/hiking-groups/by-category/practical-information) to ask information about hiking trails, conditions, trail closures, bear attacks, etc.
- The [rules](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1835212146753367) of the group are minimalistic and mostly common sense: as long as you are respectful and stay on topic, you can participate to the group.
- The group provides a chat for meetups.

## Safety warnings

::alert{type="danger" icon="lucide:circle-x"}
  Be aware that hikes and scrambles advertised on this group might range from a little walk along the river to extremely difficult scrambles. Do your own research to ensure that you know what you are getting into and be prepared to be self-reliant in case the group you join needs to split. When in doubt, ask the event's organizer. Event organizers are not guides responsible for your safety. They are simply hiking companions who are advertising their hikes.

The group isn't a structured organization. Each hike organizer has his/her own philosophy and rules, so make sure to confirm expectations when you join a hike. If you don't like the rules of the current organizers, you are more than welcome to advertise your own hikes with the rules you want.
