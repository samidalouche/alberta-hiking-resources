## Trail Conditions & Closures

A number of resources are available to get more information on the trail conditions (snow, mud) and closures (grizzly bears, etc).

For those new to the area, keep in mind that because of the accumulation of snow, most of the bigger hikes/objectives in the national parks
are only dry (read: accessible) from July 15th to September 15th.

Given that the weather is highly heterogeneous in the Rockies, it is often possible to find objectives that are dry before and after this period, 
but these are usually in Kananaskis. You can narrow your search to: Exshaw area, Highway 40 north of Peter Lougheed, and West Bragg Creek.
