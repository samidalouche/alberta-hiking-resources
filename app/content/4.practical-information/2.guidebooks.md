## Hiking

To start your journey in the Canadian Rockies:
- [Don't Waste Your Time in the Canadian Rockies](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5041-091/don%27t-waste-your-time-in-the-canadian-rockies): Their selection of hikes is an amazing starting point in the Canadian Rockies.
  The book only covers the national parks (Banff, Jasper, Kootenay, Yoho and Waterton Lakes national parks, plus Mt. Robson and Mt. Assiniboine provincial parks), not the Kananaskis / Canmore region.

## Scrambling

The two popular scrambling references used by the local community are:
- [Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies (Alan Kane)](https://a.co/d/04zppz97): Covers Waterton, Crowsnest, Kananaskis, Canmore, Banff, Yoho, Kootenay, and Jasper
- [More Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies (Andrew Nugara)](https://a.co/d/0i6t2ZM8): Comprehensively covers Waterton, The Castle, and Kananaskis. Also includes scrambles in Crowsnest, Banff, Highway 93 North, and Yoho.

For those interested in scrambling in Montana Glacier National Park, just south of the border:
