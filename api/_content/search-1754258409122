When posting, be sure to include the date, time, and location. Feel free to share photos—but only from events listed in this group. For everything else, please use other groups. Why do we have this rule in place? The reason Alberta Hikers Together has been created is because the other groups made it harder to organize or join events as the meetup posts were diluted in the amount of other information being provided. So the idea is to keep this group hyper-focused on finding hiking partners to avoid diluting the meetup posts/events. Posting pictures / trip reports is exclusively encouraged for people who post their hikes on the group, as it helps to build excitement about joining the upcoming trips. Inspirational Groups and groups providing practical information are a better match for people who want to share pictures of their adventures without the intent of sharing the trail. Finally, we want people to be specific with regard to the date, time, and specific trails/hikes that are considered. In addition to being more actionable for other members of the group, it helps combat spammers who have a tendency to post vague and unactionable requests to find hiking partners.

Woohoo! 🎉\nHere’s what a typical Summer hike looks like when the sun is shining and the vibes are high: ⸻ ⏰ Early Starts = Maximum Fun 5:00am at the trailhead is the norm 😴🌄 — sometimes even earlier for those extra-spicy objectives 🏔️🔥In Spring/Fall, we sleep in (a little) — usually around 7:00am starts, since it’s too chilly for long snack + photo breaks ❄️ ⸻ 🚦 Starts On Time, Every Time Respecting the early birds 🐦 means we start at the posted time!Meeting time = 15 mins before the hike begins.\nSo if the hike starts at 5am and you roll up at 5:05… you’re actually 20 minutes late. Oops! ⏳😅 ⸻ 📸 Picture Breaks Galore When the sun’s out and the mountains are sparkling ✨, I’m on a photo frenzy. Expect lots of stops!Hate photo breaks? Join a colder weather hike — the colder it is, the fewer pics I take 😬📷Love being trail-famous? Wear bright colors and strike a pose — I share all pics in full-res after! 🎨👯‍♂️🖼️ ⸻ 🐢🏃‍♂️ “Moderate” Pace — Whatever That Means I say moderate… but everyone defines that differently 🤷‍♂️Boring trail? We zoom 🛣️💨\nEpic views? We slow to a crawl for photos and oohs and ahhs 🐌📸🌄If the event is listed as “fast,” I mean it! Otherwise, expect a mixed rhythm that adapts to the trail. ⸻ 🧀🛋️ Summit = Lounge Zone If the weather’s nice, expect to chill for hours at the top 😎🧺\nFood, naps, views, deep chats — it’s a summit hang, not a summit sprint.Not a fan of long breaks? You’ve got options:\n👋 It’s cool to split off early if you want to head down.🧊 Come on colder-season hikes — I’m not a summit-sitter when it’s freezing! ⸻ 🏁 Finishing with Style Goal = wrap up by 5pm, especially on Saturdays so we can:🏊‍♂️ Go for a cold dip🍻 Celebrate with a post-hike beer🏕️ Still have time to chill at camp🛌 💤 Go to bed early, to be ready for another adventure the next day!📆 On Sundays (Fundays), I’m happy to finish later — let traffic pass and ride the mellow wave home 🚗 ⸻ Ready for adventure? Bring good vibes, bright gear, and maybe a snack to share 😄👟🌈\nSee you on the trail! 🏔️💛","titles":["Sami","🥾 What to Expect on a Classic Sami Hike"]},"48":{"title":"⚠️ Your Safety = Your Responsibility","content":"Just a friendly heads-up: I’m not a pro mountain guide 🧢❌⛰️.\nI’ve got average navigation skills, decent mountain sense, and a big love for adventure — but you are 100% in charge of your own safety, prep, and decisions 🧭🥾 Think of me as your enthusiastic trail buddy, not your personal GPS or mountain guru 🤓✨ ⸻ 📌 Here’s what that means in practice: ❗ Don’t assume I fully know what I’m doing — I often have plans, but Mother Nature might have other ideas ☁️🪨🔍 Do your own research — read up, map it out, and know what you’re getting into🗺️ Bring your own maps and route info — be ready in case we need to split or adjust plans🧃 Pack food + water like we’re doing an epic — sunny days + long breaks = thirstier hikers 😅☀️🪖 Bring the right gear (helmet, spikes, axe, whatever the mountain calls for). Not sure? Ask the crew!🔦 Plans change! Extra layers and a headlamp can go from “nice to have” to “thank goodness I brought this” real fast 🌄🥶 ⸻ The mountain doesn’t care how confident we sound — so let’s all come prepared, stay humble, and have each other’s backs 💚🏕️🧠 We’ll have way more fun knowing we’ve got the essentials just in case! 👣🎒","titles":["Sami","🥾 What to Expect on a Classic Sami Hike"]},"49":{"title":"🧩 Sticking Together vs. Splitting the Group","content":"Ah yes — the great trail debate: Should we all hike together like one big happy trail family? 👣👨‍👩‍👧‍👦\nOr is it cool to split up if people are vibing at different paces? 🤷‍♂️🏃‍♀️🐢 Here’s my take:\nI’m 100% chill with splitting — especially in bigger groups (7–9 folks). It’s totally normal for different hikers to settle into different paces 🚶‍♀️🏃‍♂️ and honestly, forcing a group to move as one mega-hiker can make things feel clunky and weird. ✨ Live and let hike! ✨\nSharing part of the trail is still sharing something special — even if we don’t stick together the whole way 🏔️🧡 ⸻ 🧭 But What If Someone Overestimated the Hike? It happens — we’re all human (and occasionally overconfident 😅).\nIf someone’s not feeling it, my take is: unless it’s a safety emergency, we should look for smart, kind options 💡❤️ — like having them chill at a scenic spot while the group continues. 🔁 Loops are trickier than out-and-backs, so let’s think things through before we split. ⸻ 🧠 Things to Keep in Mind if We Do Split: 🐻 Minimum group size rules (hello, Parks Canada bear safety!) mean splitting may not be allowed↩️ Out-and-backs are easier to manage — we’ll be returning the same way anyway!🗺️ Everyone should have maps + route info — don’t assume someone else has it!🧗‍♂️ How technical is the hike? A mellow walk or a spicy scramble?🚶‍♀️ Is the trail busy or are we totally alone in the wilderness?🚗 Carpool chaos is real — don’t leave your ride behind without a plan 😬 ⸻ BTW — this goes both ways! 💯\nThere have been times when I didn’t feel good about pushing for a summit and waited for the group to go up and come back. It’s all about mutual respect and using common sense 🧘‍♂️🌤️ If you’re someone who really prefers sticking together the whole time, no problem! Just let me know before the hike so we can set expectations and avoid awkward trail drama 🗣️🤝 ⸻ Bottom line: We use our brains, our hearts, and our GPS 📍💚🗺️ — and try not to split the group in silly ways. Deal?","titles":["Sami","🥾 What to Expect on a Classic Sami Hike"]},"50":{"title":"🏕️ What to Expect on a Multi-Day Camping or Hut Trip","content":"First things first — my fave multi-day trips are the chill, flexible, go-with-the-flow kind 😎🌄. That means: no pressure to do everything together. Seriously. The best vibes happen when everyone feels free to do their own thing by day — hike solo, chill at camp, chase peaks, nap in a meadow 💤🌼 — and then come together in the evening for laughs, shared food, and cozy campfire hangs 🔥🍲🌌. Here’s why I love this style: 🗺️ Everyone’s explored different trails — we’ve all got different “must-dos”🐢🐇 Pace, break style, and start time vary a lot — mine are in the previous section, but I adapt depending on the vibe & weather 🌦️🧘‍♀️ Some folks need chill rest days; others are ready to send it daily 💪🤝 We don’t need to match 100% — just be upfront about your style/preferences!🔄 Bad weather tends to mellow everyone out anyway (later starts, shorter hikes), so magic compatibility can happen unexpectedly ☁️💫 ☀️🌧️ How Weather & Smoke Shape My Plans: Bluebird skies + warm temps? Count me in for early starts and long, leisurely summit hangs 😍📸Smoky skies? I’m out. Those are rest/snack/book/lake float days 😷📖🛶Cloudy but dry? Let’s hit the mid-tier hikes — still fun, just a little less photogenic ☁️Rainy? You’ll need to be my motivational hype squad to get me up 1200m for a whiteout summit 😂⛰️☔️ ⸻ 🎯 Bottom line: We don’t need to do everything together to have a great trip — just be kind, be clear, and be open to adapting.

Mine? I like to squeeze the juice out of every hiking day 🍋👣 Here’s what I’m aiming for: 📸 Plenty of photo breaks — yes, we’re hiking, but also yes, you will be asked to pose on a rock like a majestic mountain goat 🐐✨🏔️ Long summit hangs — think hours at the top, soaking in views, sunshine, snacks, and trail tea 🧃☀️🧀🍻 Early finish (~5pm) — so we can celebrate with a cold dip 🏊‍♂️ and a cold beer 🍺 (or both!), followed by real food and early zzz’s 😴🛠️ Wiggle room for chaos — because let’s be real: plans are great until the trail says “plot twist!” 🤪⛰️ To make all that magic happen, we start early. Like, really early.\nReal-life examples: 🌅 Pharaoh Peak: started at 4am, caught sunrise at Healy Pass 🌄 (August 2022)🏞️ Skyline Trail: started at 5am, because Jasper sun waits for no one 😎 (September 2023) Oh — and just so you know, both of those were listed as “FAST” hikes 🏃‍♀️💨, not your average leisurely strolls.

When I post a hike, the meeting time is actually 15 minutes before we hit the trail 🥾⏳ — that buffer is built in for bathroom breaks 🚻, gear tweaks 🎒, and tying those stubborn boot laces 👟. So if we start hiking “on time,” we’ve actually already waited 15 minutes ⌛ — which feels like a fair grace period, right? Is 15 minutes a fair wait? I think so! 🤷‍♂️If not… what is? 🤔 Should we bring a stopwatch and take votes? 😄 Here’s why I stick to this system: 📶 Many trailheads have no cell service, so waiting around for a text that never comes just doesn’t work.🧊 Early mornings can be chilly, and it’s not fair to leave the punctual folks shivering while we wait.✅ It keeps things simple, consistent, and respectful of everyone’s time — especially at 4am when we’re all half-asleep anyway 😴☕️ Bottom line: I love hiking with people… but I also love starting on time.
